Dear [company] team,

I am currently organizing a Node.js beginners event on [date-time].
With [number-of-mentors] Node mentors, we are going to help about [number-of-attendees] attendees to
learn programming with Node through a set of [self-paced](http://nodeschool.io/)
challenges. It's a nice proven concept and has already been held in
several cities around the world.

We are still looking for sponsors to cover some of the costs. For 
[drinks-budget] you could sponsor drinks for all the attendees and also for 
[stickers-budget] sponsor stickers, which are intended to be badges for accomplished
challenges. 

We will promote your logo on the [event page](http://nodeschool.io/malang/) and the [ticket-page]
as well as during the event. We are also happy if some of you employees
help out as mentors or even join as learners.

Best,
[me]
